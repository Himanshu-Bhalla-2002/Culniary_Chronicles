<h1 align="center">🍲 Culinary Chronicles: Celebrating Culinary Diversity in College! 🌍</h1>
<br/>
<h2>🎯 Goal</h2>
To create a platform where students from diverse cultural backgrounds can share their native dishes, thereby assisting the college mess committee in curating a menu that resonates with the rich tapestry of student cultures.

<h2>🚫 Problem</h2>
With students hailing from various regions and cultures, the college mess often finds it challenging to cater to the diverse culinary preferences. Traditional menus might overlook the rich variety of dishes that different cultures have to offer.

<h2>💡 Impact</h2>
By introducing dishes from various native places, we not only celebrate diversity but also make students feel more at home. This initiative fosters inclusivity, ensuring that every student's cultural heritage is acknowledged and appreciated.
